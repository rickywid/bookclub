## BookStax

This is a full stack application where I used React on the front end and Nodejs, Postgres and Heroku on the back end. BookStax allows readers to keep track of the their books by managing their list with a drag and drop UI. Users can view, comment and like other users profiles. Users can login through email or social login via Google or Facebook.
